Amity School of Applied Sciences (ASAS) basically runs programs in sciences and has fully functional Chemistry and Physics labs up to graduate as well as post graduate level along with the lecture rooms. The labs are also equipped for engineering as well as biotechnology students. All the labs and classrooms are fully air-conditioned. At Amity classrooms are augmented with integrated audio-visual teaching aids for lectures, presentations etc.</p>
<p>
There are well equipped one physics lab, one dark room and one chemistry lab, where we nurture more than 200 students and bringing them to practice and experience the theory part of the syllabus.</p>

<strong>Physics Lab</strong></p>
<p>
Physics is an empirical science and not a mere collection of mathematical laws. In this sense practical is an appropriate counterpart for the more theoretic and mathematical Physics. The Physics laboratory is the place where the students learn to practice the activities of scientists - asking questions, performing procedures, collecting data, analyzing data, answering questions, and thinking of new questions to explore.</p>

The Physics laboratory is well equipped with experiments based on mechanics, optics heat and sound etc., where undergraduate and post graduate students perform experiments. There is separate section called &lsquo;dark room&rsquo; where experiments related to light such as Newton&rsquo;s ring, Fraunhoffer single slit diffraction, wavelength of light using spectrometer can be performed. It is the best place to learn and explore physics.</p>

<strong>Chemistry Lab </strong></p>
<p>
All the latest and high-quality apparatus and instruments are available in the chemistry to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of the substances, volumetric analysis, colorimetry, organic synthesis, water analysis, soil analysis and to carry out student research work. Distillation unit, Muffle Furness to achieve very high temperature, oven, UV spectrophotometer, pH meter, potentiometer, centrifuge, viscometer, incubator cum shaker, oil bath and many more are the major attraction of chemistry lab.</p>
