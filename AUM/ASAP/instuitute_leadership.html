"So dear Teacher, will you please take him by his hand and teach him things he will have to know...<br />
Teach him to sell his talents and brains to the highest bidder but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul...<br />
Teach him to have sublime faith in himself, because then he will always have sublime faith in mankind&rdquo;,</div>

Just three lines randomly picked from the letter written by Abraham Lincoln to his son&rsquo;s school teacher, on the day his son started school.</p>
<p>
We at Amity School of Architecture &amp; Planning believe in doing just what Abraham Lincoln wanted his son&rsquo;s school teacher to do&hellip;taking them by their hands&hellip; &hellip;but at the same time we will gently yet firmly and slowly pull out our fingers from their handholds, letting them go ahead&hellip;staying a step back to buttress them in case they falter or miss their step&hellip;or in case they look back for help!</p>

Today the professional world out there is fiercely competitive and as such the students need to be prepared for the same. In order to make the students &lsquo;battle-ready&rsquo; we have drafted our Syllabus after studying, understanding and analyzing the syllabi of many colleges. Add to this a faculty family that is a potent mix of experience (over three decades in the field) and youth, professionals and academicians and a blend of specializations that span general architecture to urban planning, urban design to landscape and environmental planning to sustainable architecture. To support them we have practicing civil engineers, interior designers, linguists and psychologists.</p>
<p>
We strive to ensure that the students who graduate tomorrow should be able to proudly rub shoulders with us and moreover we should be equally proud to do the same.</p>
