"Dear Teacher, please hold his hand and teach him all he needs to know...<br />
Teach him to sell his strengths and brains for the greatest bid but never his heart and soul.<br />
Teach him to have sublime faith in himself, and he will always have sublime faith in humanity.&rdquo;,</div>

    At Amity School of Architecture & Planning, we take our students by the hand and then gently, firmly, and slowly remove our fingers, allowing them to move forward. Maintain a step back to support them if they falter or seek aid. </p>
<p>
    Today's professional world is competitive, so students must be prepared. After researching, learning, and analysing various college syllabi, we created our syllabus to make pupils "battle-ready." Add to this a faculty family with over three decades of experience, youth, professionals, and academicians, and specialisations ranging from general architecture to urban planning, urban design, landscape and environmental planning, and sustainable architecture. Civil engineers, interior designers, linguists, and psychiatrists assist them.</p>
<p>
    We hope tomorrow's graduates can proudly join us, and we should be proud to do the same.
