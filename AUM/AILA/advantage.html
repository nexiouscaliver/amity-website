        No other institute in India offers a meaningful combination like Economics and Social Work or Political Science and Social Work although the success in both these fields is much enhanced with grass root work.</li>
        <li>
        You can allow your creative side to develop (with Fine Arts, Animation or Fashion Technology) together with the theoretical subjects of Economics/Politics/History.</li>
        <li>
        The course is such designed that you can do your masters even in the minor field.</li>
        <li>
        To ensure that you get some additional skills, you would be taking two professional courses in summer: (a) On Social Media Advertising and Journalism and (b) On Travel and Tourism.</li>
        <li>
        Unlike other Institutes in India that offer Liberal Arts, Amity University Mumbai allows you to choose your minors from its full fledged Institutes that offer many programs in that chosen field.</li>
        <li>
        You would get to learn a Foreign Language and a course on Behavioral Science too. In addition, for four electives, you can choose from any course that is being offered in the University.</li>
        <li>
        The pedagogy would be very inclusive in nature that would consist of not just lectures but class discussions, role play, showing documentaries, field visits and research. There would be internships involving community work and environment preservation.</li>
        <li>
        Class size would be kept small to ensure close contact between the teachers and students.</li>
        <li>
        Our graduates would be confident to face the world, would have variety of skills to undertake interdisciplinary as well as specialized projects, and would be sensitive to a range of societal issues.</li>
        <li>
        If you join BSW or MSW, we offer you the unique opportunity of learning all aspects of social work. Our graduates will not be bound by artificial walls of "specialization". You would be able to take up a job in place that requires Community Development, CSR, Mental Health, Disability, Child and Family Welfare or any such field.</li>
        <li>
        All the faculty members have PhD's in their field of specialization.</li>
