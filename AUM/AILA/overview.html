    <p>
    Established in 2015, Amity Institute of Liberal Arts (AILA), firmly believes in giving liberty to students in exploring what they are good at and defining their subjects of study from a wide choice. It does not assume that each student comes ready with the self-knowledge of what they are good at; it enables them to look around. Students are taught to work with real world during both coursework and internships to make them ready to face the world confidently. The teaching-learning-evaluating methods are innovative to enable all round personality development rather than mere rote learning. The students would be trained to gain knowledge and analytical skills to understand the real implications of world events, policies and actions. They would also be made aware of the realities of the vulnerable sections of the society and make them committed to public welfare. The institute provides diverse opportunities for the students to engage in creative thinking, critical analysis, and hands on experience. The institute prepares students to pursue higher studies, take up rewarding jobs or become entrepreneurs.</p>

    The experiential learning methodology inspires students to deliberate, discuss, converse, contest, conceptualize, reinvent, transform, and create systems for well being of human civilization. Discussion and debates include plural, different and multiple viewpoints, perspectives, ideas, concepts, interpretations and thought processes.</p>
