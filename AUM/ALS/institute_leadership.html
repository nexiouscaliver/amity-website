                The legal profession is one of the oldest in the world and has long been recognised as the profession of the learned. From its earliest days, lawyers and the law itself have been held in high esteem across the globe.</p>
            <p>
                As democratic institutions have grown and the Rule of Law has become the foundation of democracy and good governance, the legal profession has gained unprecedented importance. Providing high quality legal education through institutions of excellence is essential to maintain the profession’s standards and to meet the needs of governance under the law. Many universities and law schools in the West embraced this vision more than a century ago.</p>
            <p>
                In India, legal education received a major impetus with the introduction of the five year integrated undergraduate programme and the establishment of National Law Universities and Schools in almost every state. The idea of transforming legal education has been realised by a new generation of law schools that attract talented students through a specialised admission process and prepare them for the demands of the profession.</p>
            <p>
                Amity Law School in Mumbai, established by Amity University, stands at the forefront of this new wave. In less than five years it has earned a reputation as one of the most sought after centres of excellence in legal education. At Amity Law School we follow a rigorous and forward looking curriculum while meeting the requirements of the Bar Council of India. Our team of motivated and dedicated faculty members lead academic, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities such as moot courts, client counselling, internships, seminars and workshops with energy and commitment. A key strength for the school is its location in Mumbai, the financial capital of the country. We have already built strong relationships with leading corporate organisations, NGOs and law firms to help our students learn practical skills through internships and secure valuable placements.</p>
            <p>
                Undergraduate courses remain our main focus, but we give equal attention to postgraduate and research programmes. We offer a one year LLM with a range of specialisations. Our primary research areas include criminal law, constitutional law and commercial law, and we are expanding into policy research in both public and private law. Our students are our most important stakeholders. They are not passive recipients of instruction but active participants in every aspect of life at the school.</p>
            <p>
                We are confident that Amity Law School will continue to grow as one of India’s leading centres of higher learning and gain greater visibility both nationally and internationally.</p>
